# CameraTypeView-iOS
A camera type/option view for your custom camera. It uses a collectionView, horizontally scrollable, just like what the iOS native camera uses for switching to different camera types (e.g. Photo, Video, Cinematic, etc.)
When using IB, add the width and height constraints, 250x50.
